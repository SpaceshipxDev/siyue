-- Surface "who" on the master grid. job_stage_rollup already exposes the
-- latest finish time per (job, stage); this adds the latest finisher's name so
-- the boss can hover a ✓ cell on the board and see who most recently completed
-- a part there — the same 经手 attribution the per-component cells already show
-- on job detail, but reaching the aggregate master grid.
--
-- Read-only. Re-creates job_stage_rollup from its current (post-0020) shape,
-- adding ps.by_actor into ps_eff and a latest_by_actor column appended at the
-- tail (CREATE OR REPLACE VIEW only allows new columns at the end).
